{"name":"Pssh","tagline":"Pair Programming made user-friendly with your web browser.","body":"Ever have an itch to show code off to your buddies? Or how about make an ASCII dog\r\nrun across the screen while your co-workers watch in awe?\r\n\r\nWhat about just wanting to pair program without all the hassle of setting up an SSH\r\nuser, figuring out how the heck to get tmux to integrate everything, and then\r\nopening up port 22 on your firewall to let everyone know you're ready and willing\r\nfor the all the brute force attacks your network can handle.\r\n\r\nWhat if it was as simple as opening up a new shell, or a tab in tmux or screen,\r\ntyping four letters, then sharing a URL with a friend?\r\n\r\nPssh. Is that even possible?\r\n\r\nYup.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n> gem install pssh\r\n# to get started, just run it from the command line\r\n> pssh\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt defaults to running on port 8022, but throw in a `-p PORT` flag and you're\r\nup and running on whatever port.  If you're in a tmux or screen session, it'll\r\nshare that.  If you're not, no worries. **Pssh has its own session sharing built in.**\r\n\r\nIf you're already in a tmux or screen session, you'll have a pseudo-terminal\r\nthat lets you see who's connected, kick people off, and a few other handy things.\r\n\r\nIf you started `pssh` in a plain shell, you'll be immediately transported into\r\nthat shell. Just type `exit` to quit and kick everyone else off too.\r\n\r\nCheck out all the options with the `-h` flag, or list the console commands by\r\ntyping `help` when you start up Pssh inside tmux/screen.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptions:\r\n        --readonly        Only allow viewing the session, not writing.\r\n    -p, --port PORT       Set the port that Pssh will run on\r\n    -s, --socket NAME     Set the socket that will be used for connecting (socket-name)\r\n    -h, --help            Display this help.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's also support for HTTP basic authentication when combined with <a href=\"https://getportly.com\">Portly</a>.\r\n\r\nInstall Portly in seconds, add `localhost:8022` to your connections, and you can\r\nadd authentication and share a classy URL right there on the spot.\r\n\r\nThanks to those who are working on <a href=\"https://github.com/chjj/term.js/\">term.js</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aluzzardi/wssh\">WSSH</a> for making the job easier.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/portly/pssh.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/portly/pssh)","google":"UA-6180282-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
